# VR Interaction Scripts (Unity C#)

This repository contains **C# scripts** I created for virtual reality development in Unity.  
They demonstrate various **interaction systems** and **XR mechanics**, focusing on hand-based interaction, avatar setup, and environmental feedback.

---

## Overview

The scripts demonstrate various VR Interaction concepts in Unity, including:
- Setting up **custom colliders and poke interactions**
- Handling **material and lighting changes** dynamically
- Managing **coin collection and object triggers**
- Sending and receiving **slider values** for experimental data or UI feedback
